## Graph Learning

The field mainly focused on applying deep learning on non euclidean data like graphical data using architectures like Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Neural Networks etc.

## Meta-Learning
A highly active area of recent research, which aims to learn models which can be easily adpated to learn new tasks often said as "learning to learn".

## Active Learning
Deals with problem of expensive data labelling and tries to figure out which unlablled data points to label so as to bring maximum improvement to model performance.
